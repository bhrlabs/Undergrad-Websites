<p style="color: white; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;"><span class="style5">A Micro mouse is a small robot vehicle that is able to navigate
            its way through an unknown maze. It is autonomous, battery-operated and selfcontained,
            encompassing computer technology, robotics and artificial intelligence. The main
            challenge for the Micro mouse designers is to import the Micro mouse with an adaptive
            intelligence which enables exploration of different maze configurations, and to
            work out the optimum route with the shortest run time from start to destination
            and back. In addition, the Micro mouse must reliably negotiate the maze at a very
            high speed without crashing into the maze walls. This workshop will provide college
            students a base to robotics. They will learn the Automation technology and get better
            understanding and grip on its application. They will be developing their own models
            by their own hands. These projects focus on the application and use of technology
            rather than their internal working so that a person can grasp the concepts well.
