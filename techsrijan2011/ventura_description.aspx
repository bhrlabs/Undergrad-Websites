            <p class="style8">Induction Cooker is also called as Induction stove, 
            Induction cook-top is smarter and easier way to cook food and it is an energy saver too! . 
            Gas and electrical cook-tops have been commonly 
            used in kitchen for decades, but as technology improves there are a lot of changes evolved in methods of cooking. 
            One of the latest innovations in this field is the induction cooker.Induction cooktop works by creating an electromagnetic 
            field which only used to heat up the pan and doesn’t heat cooktop surface itself. Induction cooking is far 
            quicker than the other conventional method of cooking. In Induction cooking the temperature changes are instantaneous.

            <p class="style8">With the extraordinary increase of the demand for mobile computing systems 
            (and thus, also of the number of such devices), WiFi   networks have also become quite popular. One on the most 
            serious problems faced by the users of such networks is that of finding an area where the signal is strong enough to 
            allow a decent connection to the Internet. That's exactly the reason why all sorts of 
            devices that indicate the quality of the signal have been developed, one of the most interesting being the WiFi Pen.<br /><br />
